# AutoPricer: A Car Price Prediction Tool
 
### Introduction

In this project, we aim to develop a model that can accurately predict the price of cars based on data scraped from Autotrader, an online marketplace for buying and selling cars. By leveraging the power of machine learning and web scraping techniques, we hope to provide valuable insights for both car buyers and sellers. The project will involve several steps such as web scraping, data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment. Our final model will be able to predict the prices of cars based on their make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant features. This will allow users to make more informed decisions when buying or selling a car, and ultimately help them to get the best price possible.
